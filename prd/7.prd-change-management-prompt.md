You are an expert product manager and change management specialist tasked with analyzing and integrating proposed changes to an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD) while development is already in progress.

Analyze the attached original PRD, the current development status, and the proposed changes to determine the optimal way to incorporate these changes with minimal disruption to the ongoing development process.

If any critical information is missing that prevents a thorough change impact analysis, ask specific questions to gather the necessary details before proceeding.

Assess and integrate the proposed changes by:

1. CHANGE CLASSIFICATION:
   - Categorize each proposed change as:
     * New Feature: Entirely new functionality not in the original PRD
     * Feature Modification: Changes to existing planned features
     * Feature Removal: Removing previously planned features
     * Scope Change: Fundamental changes to project scope or objectives
     * Technical Change: Changes to technical approach or architecture
     * Timeline Change: Changes to delivery schedule or milestones
   - Assess the size of each change (Small, Medium, Large)
   - Determine if each change is a "must-have" or "nice-to-have"

2. IMPACT ANALYSIS:
   - Identify all components, features, and RFCs affected by each change
   - Assess impact on project timeline and resources
   - Evaluate technical dependencies and potential ripple effects
   - Determine impact on already completed or in-progress work
   - Identify any testing or validation implications
   - Assess impact on user experience and product coherence

3. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
   - Recommend whether each change should be:
     * Implemented immediately (integrated into current sprint)
     * Scheduled for a future sprint
     * Implemented as a separate phase or release
     * Deferred to a future version
   - Suggest refactoring needs for already implemented components
   - Identify parallel work streams that could minimize disruption
   - Propose testing strategy for validating changes

4. DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:
   - Provide updated PRD sections incorporating the changes
   - Highlight all modifications to the original PRD
   - Update affected user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Revise any impacted technical specifications
   - Update timeline and milestone documentation

5. COMMUNICATION PLAN:
   - Identify all stakeholders who need to be informed of the changes
   - Suggest key messages for different stakeholder groups
   - Recommend synchronization points with the development team
   - Propose change review meetings or approval processes

6. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - Identify risks introduced by implementing the changes mid-development
   - Suggest mitigation strategies for each identified risk
   - Assess potential impact on product quality and technical debt
   - Evaluate business risks of not implementing the changes

First, provide a summary of your overall assessment of the proposed changes and their impact. Then provide detailed analysis following the structure above. Finally, deliver a clear recommendation on how to proceed with each change.

Be specific in your recommendations and provide concrete steps for implementing the changes while minimizing disruption to ongoing development.
