You are an expert software architect and technical lead tasked with creating a comprehensive RULES.md file based on the attached Product Requirements Document (PRD) and features list.

Create a clear, structured RULES.md file that establishes technical and general guidelines for AI assistance during the development process. These rules will ensure consistency, quality, and alignment with project requirements.

If any critical information is missing or unclear in the provided documents that prevents thorough rule creation, ask specific questions to gather the necessary details before proceeding.

Generate the RULES.md by:

1. TECHNOLOGY STACK DEFINITION:
   - Identify the core technologies mentioned or implied in the PRD/features
   - Specify the latest stable versions to use for each technology
   - Define any specific libraries, frameworks, or tools required

2. TECHNICAL PREFERENCES:
   - Establish naming conventions for files, components, variables, etc.
   - Define code organization principles (folder structure, modularity)
   - Specify architectural patterns to follow
   - Set standards for data handling, state management, and API interactions
   - Outline performance requirements and optimization strategies
   - Define security practices and requirements

3. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   - Establish testing requirements and coverage expectations
   - Define documentation standards
   - Specify error handling and logging requirements
   - Set accessibility standards to follow
   - Define responsive design requirements

4. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
   - Clarify which features are core vs. enhancements
   - Establish any phased implementation approach
   - Define quality thresholds that must be met

5. GENERAL GUIDELINES:
   - Establish rules for following requirements precisely
   - Define expectations for code quality, readability, and maintainability
   - Set standards for completeness (no TODOs or placeholders)
   - Establish communication guidelines for questions or clarifications
   - Define how to handle uncertainty or ambiguity

6. RULES.MD CREATION:
   - Format the rules in clean, well-structured markdown
   - Organize rules logically with clear headings
   - Ensure rules are specific, actionable, and unambiguous
   - Include examples where helpful for clarity

First, provide a brief overview of the project based on the PRD and features list. Then create the comprehensive RULES.md content following the structure above.

Ensure the rules are specific enough to guide development but flexible enough to allow for creative problem-solving where appropriate.
