Invalid value for N8N_LOG_LEVEL - Invalid enum value. Expected 'error' | 'warn' | 'info' | 'debug' | 'silent', received 'verbose'. Falling back to default value.
Permissions 0644 for n8n settings file /Users/thaleslaray/.n8n/config are too wide. This is ignored for now, but in the future n8n will attempt to change the permissions automatically. To automatically enforce correct permissions now set N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true (recommended), or turn this check off set N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=false.
